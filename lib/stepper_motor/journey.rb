# StepperMotor is a module for building multi-step flows where steps are sequential and only
# ever progress forward. The building block of StepperMotor is StepperMotor::Journey
module StepperMotor
  # A Journey is the main building block of StepperMotor. You create a journey to guide a particular model
  # ("hero") through a sequence of steps. Any of your model can be the hero and have multiple Journeys. To create
  # your own Journey, subclass the `StepperMotor::Journey` class and define your steps. For example, a drip mail
  # campaign can look like this:
  #
  #   class ResubscribeCampaign < StepperMotor::Journey
  #     step do
  #       ReinviteMailer.with(recipient: hero).deliver_later
  #     end
  #
  #     step, wait: 3.days do
  #       cancel! if hero.active?
  #       ReinviteMailer.with(recipient: hero).deliver_later
  #     end
  #
  #     step, wait: 3.days do
  #       cancel! if hero.active?
  #       ReinviteMailer.with(recipient: hero).deliver_later
  #     end
  #
  #     step, wait: 3.days do
  #       cancel! if hero.active?
  #       hero.close_account!
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Creating a record for the Journey (just using `create!`) will instantly send your hero on their way:
  #
  #    ResubscribeCampaign.create!(hero: current_account)
  #
  # To stop the journey forcibly, delete it from your database - or call `cancel!` within any of the steps.
